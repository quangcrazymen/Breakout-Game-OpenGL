# Breakout game using OPENGL

## How to build:
This is a visual studio project. Just open .sln file with visual studio 22, and the project just runs.
I used IrrKlang to play audio in the game, please go into ${SolutionDir}/dlls and manually copy all the dlls and paste into the build folder for now(Sorry for the inconvenience, I'll add some scripts later ðŸ˜…)
