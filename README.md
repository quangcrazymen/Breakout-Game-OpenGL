# Breakout game using OPENGL

## How to build:

> ðŸ’» This is a visual studio project. Just open .sln file with visual studio 22, and the project just runs.

> ðŸŽ™ I used [IrrKlang](https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/) to play audio in the game, please go into <mark style="background-color:rgb(252, 248, 227);">**${SolutionDir}/dlls**</mark> and manually copy all the dlls and paste into the build folder for now(Sorry for the inconvenience, I'll add some scripts later ðŸ˜…)
